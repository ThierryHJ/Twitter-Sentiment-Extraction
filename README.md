# Twitter-Sentiment-Extraction

### How did I start?

Pull the Kaggle Python Docker image. For any details for the Docker installation see [this blog post](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/02/05/how-to-get-started-with-data-science-in-containers/) or https://docs.docker.com.

```
$ docker pull kaggle/python  
```

The image is large and therefore it can take some time to download all layers. Once itâ€™s downloaded, you can list the image including the size info: 
```
$ docker image ls kaggle/python
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
kaggle/python       latest              09a349977ca7        2 weeks ago         12.5GB
```
